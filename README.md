# RetroPoker
RetroPoker is a Texas Hold'em client/server application written in Python 3.6. The server is running on an Azure VM and can tested by launching either the Windows or MacOS client.  

server.exe and videos can be found on Google drive:

The client application runs smoothly on Windows, Macs (or iPads using Pythonista 3 and the older non GUI version).

If you are brave enough to run the executable, the mac version is in a zip file format. You will need to do ctrl-click to open it (otherwise it will tell you that security settings prevent this type of file to be opened). On the windows .exe file, there's also a warning but if you click "more info" in the warning dialog box, it then gives you the option to "run anyway". 

Have Fun!
