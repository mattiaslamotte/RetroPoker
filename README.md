# RetroPoker
RetroPoker is a Texas Hold'em client/server application written in Python 3.6.

server.exe and videos can be found on Google drive:

As long as it's not for commercial purposes, feel free to make any changes you wish to the client application.

The client application runs smoothly on Windows, Macs (or iPads using Pythonista 3 and the older non GUI version).

You can also run the server on your own machine. There's a video on the google drive explaining how to set up your own server.

If you want to set up your own server, you need to manually change the IP address of the server in the source code (just search for IP= around line 40). 

If you are brave enough to run the executable, the mac version is in a zip file format. You will need to do ctrl-click to open it (otherwise it will tell you that security settings prevent this type of file to be opened). On the windows .exe file, there's also a warning but if you click "more info" in the warning dialog box, it then gives you the option to "run anyway". 

Have Fun!
